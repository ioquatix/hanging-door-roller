This repository contains parts to mount a sliding door on a rail.

## Motivation

When I was renovating my house, I had to remove the sliding doors. The existing sliding door was hanging too low for the new carpet and underlay (it's a few mm thicker) and the existing bracket did not have the range of adjustment to suit the thicker carpet. Understandably, after 20 or so years, the rubber wheels were perished too. I looked at what was available in New Zealand and not only were the replacements pretty expensive, they wouldn't really suit the poor installation of the existing doors.

The rails in my house are mounted too high into the wall and it's not possible to simply remove the door by unhooking it and lifting it off. The design of the included part allows you to install the wheel bracket separately from the door, and then attach them. This process is difficult but I'm not sure if there is an alternative, and it does work.

## Parts Required

These parts are for one roller, you'll need two rollers per door minimum.

- 3x M4 36mm bolts and nuts for joining the base with the bracket.
- 1x [M8 20mm bolt for mounting the wheel](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/304-stainless-steel-round-mushroom-Hexagon-Hexagon-M8-20mm/32357038228.html).
- 1x [M8 wheel](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/10PCS-Free-Shipping-608zz-bearing-coated-POM-cashbox-roller-shutter-8mm-30mm-8-5mm-shower-glass/32594047772.html).

## Instructions

The best method is to get everything ready - wheels on the rail, and door in position. Then, one bracket at a time, position chopsticks or another suitable wedge (I used in addition to chopsticks, an old chisel) to lift up the door. Slide a finger in and push one corner of the bracket into the base. Once you get this in it should be reasonably easy to push the entire unit together and bolt it together.
